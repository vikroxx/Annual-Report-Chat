  "description": "The image displays a table titled \"Energy consumption (MWh)\" that breaks down the consumption of energy into different categories for three fiscal years: FY21, FY22, and FY23.\n\nThe table is divided into three main sections: Total energy consumption, Non-renewable sources, and Renewable sources.\n\n1. **Total energy consumption**:\n   - FY21: 397,500 MWh\n   - FY22: 452,600 MWh\n   - FY23: 475,400 MWh\n\n2. **Non-renewable sources**:\n   - CNG (Compressed Natural Gas):\n     - FY21: 0 MWh\n     - FY22: 600 MWh\n     - FY23: 1,300 MWh\n   - Diesel:\n     - FY21: 6,200 MWh\n     - FY22: 8,000 MWh\n     - FY23: 6,200 MWh\n   - LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas):\n     - FY21: 0 MWh\n     - FY22: 15,000 MWh\n     - FY23: 16,200 MWh\n   - Natural Gas:\n     - FY21: 45,800 MWh\n     - FY22: 27,800 MWh\n     - FY23: 32,600 MWh\n   - Petrol:\n     - FY21: 5,200 MWh\n     - FY22: 17,600 MWh\n     - FY23: 16,800 MWh\n   - Purchased electricity:\n     - FY21: 199,900 MWh\n     - FY22: 153,800 MWh\n     - FY23: 155,000 MWh\n   - Heating and Cooling:\n     - FY21: 42,300 MWh\n     - FY22: 95,000 MWh\n     - FY23: 92,600 MWh\n   - Total Non-renewable sources:\n     - FY21: 299,500 MWh\n     - FY22: 317,300 MWh\n     - FY23: 320,800 MWh\n\n3. **Renewable sources**:\n   - PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) and renewable energy certificates:\n     - FY21: 98,000 MWh\n     - FY22: 135,300 MWh\n     - FY23: 154,600 MWh\n   - Self-generated renewable energy:\n     - FY21: 0 MWh\n     - FY22: 0 MWh\n     - FY23: 0 MWh\n   - Total Renewable sources:\n     - FY21: 98,000 MWh\n     - FY22: 135,300 MWh\n     - FY23: 154,600 MWh\n\nThe layout of the table is simple with columns for each fiscal year and rows dedicated to each energy type or total, making the data easy to read and compare across the different years. The categories and figures appear in a cleanly formatted grid structure, with sharp lines dividing each cell."
