  "description": "The image displays two separate tables of data related to environmental measures and is divided into two sections.\n\n1. **Energy Intensity (MWh/US$000)**\n   - This table measures energy consumption per dollar revenue across three fiscal years (FY21, FY22, FY23).\n   - Values are:\n     - FY21: 0.0099 MWh/US$000\n     - FY22: 0.0100 MWh/US$000\n     - FY23: 0.0096 MWh/US$000\n\n2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mitigation Projects Financed Through Carbon Credits**\n   - This section presents data for three fiscal years (FY21, FY22, FY23) and is categorised further into total carbon credits cancelled (measured in tCO₂e) and mitigation activity type (expressed as percentages in Reduction and Removal).\n   - Total carbon credits cancelled:\n     - FY21: 528,000 tCO₂e\n     - FY22: 724,000 tCO₂e\n     - FY23: 933,000 tCO₂e\n   - Mitigation activity type:\n     - Reduction:\n       - FY21: 58%\n       - FY22: 86%\n       - FY23: 78%\n     - Removal:\n       - FY21: 42%\n       - FY22: 14%\n       - FY23: 22%\n\nThe tables have yellow horizontal lines which are likely used to highlight the data section headers. Each fiscal year column is aligned under its respective year, providing a clear, comparative view across the fiscal years for each data point. The tables appear well-organized, making it straightforward to compare data across years."
