  "description": "The image displays a table titled \"GHG emissions intensity\", covering the fiscal years FY21, FY22, and FY23. The table is subdivided into four main categories, each detailing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent per unit of revenue or per employee, distinguishing between location-based and market-based emissions metrics. Here are the details from the table:\n\n1. **Emissions (location-based) per dollar revenue (tCO2e/US$000)**\n   - FY21: 0.0099\n   - FY22: 0.0131\n   - FY23: 0.0157\n\n2. **Emissions (market-based) per dollar revenue (tCO2e/US$000)**\n   - FY21: N/A (Not available prior to FY22)\n   - FY22: 0.0124\n   - FY23: 0.0151\n\n3. **Emissions (location-based) per employee (tCO2e/FTE)**\n   - FY21: 1.3\n   - FY22: 1.7\n   - FY23: 2.0\n\n4. **Emissions (market-based) per employee (tCO2e/FTE)**\n   - FY21: N/A (Not available prior to FY22)\n   - FY22: 1.6\n   - FY23: 1.9\n\nThe footnotes in the table indicate that data for market-based emissions per dollar revenue and per employee were \"Not available prior to FY22\". The table provides a clear view of increasing emissions intensity over the three fiscal years across both revenue and employment metrics."
