  "description": "The image shows a table titled \"Attrition rate – overall and by gender\". This table presents the attrition rates for fiscal years FY21, FY22, and FY23, divided by gender and overall rates. The data is presented as follows:\n\n- **Women**\n  - FY21: 21.0%\n  - FY22: 23.8%\n  - FY23: 20.4%\n\n- **Men**\n  - FY21: 22.6%\n  - FY22: 25.8%\n  - FY23: 21%\n\n- **Overall**\n  - FY21: 21.5%\n  - FY22: 24.9%\n  - FY23: 20.7%\n\nBelow the table, there is a note that says:\n“*Where gender splits are reported, totals may not add up to 100% due to variances in reporting at the member firm level. The EY organization is committed to exploring how we can recognize and report gender splits beyond binary reporting at a global level.”\n\nThis footnote indicates there could be discrepancies due to reporting practices, and acknowledges an intention to address gender diversities beyond traditional binary classifications in their data reporting."
