  "description": "The image displays a table titled \"Internal inspection results all audits\", which summarizes the outcomes of inspections over three consecutive years: 2020, 2021, and 2022. The table is structured into four main rows beneath the header, each detailing different categories of audit engagements:\n\n1. **Compliant Engagements**:\n   - In 2020, 79% of audit engagements were compliant.\n   - In 2021, compliance increased to 84%.\n   - In 2022, compliance reached 85%.\n\n2. **Compliant Engagements with Areas for Improvement Identified**:\n   - In 2020, 17% of engagements were compliant but had areas identified for improvement.\n   - In 2021, this number decreased to 12%.\n   - In 2022, it further decreased to 10%.\n\n3. **Total Compliant Engagements** (sum of the first two rows):\n   - Both in 2020 and 2021, the total compliant engagements accounted for 96%.\n   - In 2022, this slightly decreased to 95%.\n\n4. **Deficient Engagements**:\n   - Throughout 2020 and 2021, 4% of engagements were marked as deficient.\n   - In 2022, deficient engagements increased to 5%.\n\nThe table also includes footnotes explaining terms used:\n- The first footnote clarifies that the findings labeled as \"improvements needed\" do not necessarily impact the overall audit conclusion significantly enough to warrant additional audit procedures or documentation changes.\n- The second footnote explains that any findings that impact the material to financial statements or auditor reports, or that were not in accordance with EY policies, are considered under \"Deficient Engagements\"."
