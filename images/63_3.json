  "description": "The image contains a table titled \"Land use assessment\", which appears to be part of a corporate or organizational report covering Fiscal Years (FY) 2021, 2022, and 2023. The table is divided into several categories and subcategories related to the use of land, particularly in relation to key biodiverse areas (KBAs).\n\nHere's a summary of the table contents:\n\n1. **Total offices in key biodiverse areas (KBAs)**\n   - **Direct intersection**: Indicates the number of offices directly intersecting KBAs. The data shows an increase over three years: 8 (FY21), 10 (FY22), and 12 (FY23).\n   - **With buffer zone**: Data was not reported (NR) for FY21 and FY22, but shows 49 offices for FY23, indicating a substantial increase following the inclusion of buffer zones in the assessment.\n\n2. **Percent of offices in KBAs**\n   - **Direct intersection**: Consistently 1% across all three fiscal years.\n   - **With buffer zone**: Not reported in FY21 and FY22, and jumps to 6% in FY23.\n\n3. **Percent of workforce in KBAs**\n   - **Direct intersection**: Consistently 1% for FY21 and FY22, with no report (NR) for FY23.\n   - **With buffer zone**: Not reported for FY21 and FY22, with a reporting of 4% in FY23.\n\nAdditionally, there is a footnote explaining that in FY23 the land use assessment approach was updated to include a buffer zone for better understanding and reporting purposes. Another footnote indicates \"NR\" stands for \"Not Reported\".\n\nThis structured presentation in the table highlights changes and trends in terms of the organizationâ€™s engagement with biodiverse areas, including a significant update to their methodology in FY23."
