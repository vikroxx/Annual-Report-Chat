  "description": "The image displays a table titled \"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (tCO₂e)\" which details the emissions data across different fiscal years (FY19, FY21, FY22, FY23). The table is divided into categories of emissions:\n\n1. **Total emissions (location-based)**: Shows a significant reduction from FY19 (1,354,000) to FY21 (394,000), followed by an increase in FY22 (597,000) and further increase in FY23 (777,000).\n2. **Total emissions (market-based)**: Not available for FY19 and FY21, with first data appearing in FY22 (563,000) and increasing in FY23 (744,000).\n3. **Scope 1**: Steadily increasing from FY19 (8,000) to FY23 (20,000).\n4. **Scope 2 (location-based)**: Decreases from FY19 (159,000) to FY21 (106,000), then increases in FY22 (148,000) and remains slightly higher in FY23 (152,000).\n5. **Scope 2 (market-based)**: Not available for FY19 and FY21, but recorded as 114,000 in FY22 and 119,000 in FY23.\n6. **Scope 3**: Shows a reduction from FY19 (1,187,000) to FY21 (278,000), followed by increases in FY22 (431,000) and FY23 (605,000).\n\nSub-categories under Scope 3:\n- **Category 3: Fuel- and energy-related activities**: Ranges from 17,000 in FY19 to 25,000 in FY23 with slight fluctuations.\n- **Category 5: Waste generated in operations**: Varies slightly around 20,000 across the fiscal years, with a drop to 18,000 in FY22.\n- **Category 6: Business travel**: Dramatically reduced from FY19 (952,000) to FY21 (47,000), then progressively increases in FY22 (230,000) and FY23 (395,000).\n- **Category 7: Employee commuting**: Drops from FY19 (199,000) to FY21 (191,000), continuing to decrease up to FY23 (165,000).\n\nThe table serves as a condensed report of a company or organization’s greenhouse gas emissions over several fiscal years, addressing both direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2), and other indirect emissions (Scope 3). The asterisk (*) at the bottom notes that market-based totals for Scope 2 and overall market-based emissions were not available prior to FY22."
