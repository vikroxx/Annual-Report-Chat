  "description": "The image shows a table titled \"Lives impacted*\" with a footnote explaining the term. The table tracks the number of lives impacted over three fiscal years (FY21, FY22, FY23). It displays the following data in a horizontal layout:\n\n- FY21: 20 million lives impacted\n- FY22: 27 million lives impacted\n- FY23: 46 million lives impacted\n\nThe footnote elaborates that the \"Lives impacted\" figures include both direct and indirect beneficiaries of EY Ripples initiatives. These initiatives support leaders of impact enterprises and their customer bases. The impact is weighted according to the depth and breadth of impact these initiatives have and is attributed to EY support. Each initiative's impact is also mapped to the most relevant Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) based on ultimate impact."
