  "description": "The image displays a simple data presentation, likely from a report or a presentation slide. It is primarily focused on showing the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over a four-year period from fiscal year 2019 to 2023 (FY19-23).\n\nAt the top, there is a heading in black text that reads \"Four-year CAGR (FY19-23).\" Below this heading, there is a yellow horizontal line that spans roughly two-thirds of the width of the heading. Underneath the yellow line, centered in a white space, the CAGR value is displayed as \"9.5%\" in large, bold font. The background of the entire image is also white, and there is a thin grey horizontal line just under the percentage value, closing off the section. The font color, size, and the minimalistic design focus on clarity and immediacy of the displayed information."
