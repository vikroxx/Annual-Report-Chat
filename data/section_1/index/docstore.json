For example, we   recently brought together all our artificial intelligence (AI)   innovation and development efforts under one platform,   EY.ai. This unified platform will help enable clients to   efficiently access the benefits of AI. It is also intended   to increase transparency, trust, and confidence in AI as   EY seeks use these new capabilities to serve the broader   interests of society and contribute to a more inclusive,   equitable future.  Charting a new course and building confidence   in new\u00a0technologies  For more than a decade, we\u2019ve embedded AI into many EY   global technology solutions and in 2021, we supercharged   this with a US$10\u00a0billion, three-year investment plan. This   has already fueled new AI capabilities and offerings that   are improving how we work with clients. AI is also playing   a critical role in our commitment to continuously improve   audit quality. We have embedded AI into the EY Canvas audit   platform to support risk assessment, and a broader use of AI   is helping EY teams challenge the effectiveness of their audit   strategy and bring greater confidence and trust to the audit.  We are also actively building the EY ecosystem and now have   more than 100 ecosystem relationships that keep us on the   leading edge of change, help us innovate and execute quickly,   and offer ever-evolving services to EY clients.  Confidence in AI is one of the current barriers to AI adoption.   It\u2019s why in 2022 we formalized EY AI principles, which   include accountability, security and privacy, transparency   and \u201cexplainability,\u201d fairness and inclusivity, and professional   responsibility. These principles guide our work with EY   people, clients, and governments and other external   Leading for the long-term  During my tenure as EY Global Chairman and CEO, I have   seen the power of placing purpose and long-term value at    the center of an organization\u2019s strategy.  Consider just a few of the challenges we\u2019ve witnessed the   past four years: a global pandemic, war in Europe, extreme   weather events, geopolitical uncertainties and rapid   technological change. Despite these and other pressures,   the EY NextWave strategy to create long-term value for all   stakeholders, stemming from our purpose of Building a better   working world, has been an anchor in an ever\u2011changing\u00a0world.  In 2019, we formalized our long-term value approach in the   EY NextWave strategy, and as a result, we\u2019ve achieved 9.5%   compound annual growth (FY 2019\u20132023) and reached   nearly US$50 billion in revenue in FY23, a 14.2% increase in   local currency. Long-term value creation is now part of our   DNA, and I am proud of the progress it has enabled for EY,   highlighted in this EY Value Realized 2023 report.  This year, we continue reporting on that progress using   the World Economic Forum\u2019s International Business Council   (WEF\u2011IBC) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. We also participate   in the United Nations Global Compact, and I confirm that   EY reaffirms its support of its Ten Principles in the areas of   human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.

We are integrating these principles into   the EY.ai\u00a0Ecosystem and are also actively engaging with   governments, multinational standard-setting bodies, industry   associations and civil-society organizations.  We intend to help lead the development of best practices   for the responsible and trustworthy use of AI. We recognize   no single organization can tackle this level of change,   safely and at speed, without collaboration. We are a   committed stakeholder focused on realizing benefits,   while addressing the risks, as we all move into this next   technological\u00a0revolution.  Understanding the critical importance    of EY people  In an era of such significant technological change, it\u2019s more   important than ever to recognize the most significant driver   of EY success: EY people. Creating long-term value for   EY\u00a0people is a core pillar of the EY NextWave strategy and   remains our focus as we support and attract the best talent   in the marketplace. For 25 years in a row, the EY organization   has been acknowledged as one the best places to work   by\u00a0Fortune.  We\u2019ve grown the global EY organization and created more   than 116,000 jobs over my tenure as CEO and are now at   nearly 400,000 people strong.\u00a0We are proud of the different   perspectives and backgrounds across the EY organization   and this year, we have introduced new DE&I metrics, such   as disability inclusion, and a global storytelling campaign   focused on elevating the importance of social equity.  One of the ways we help create long-term value for people   is through a commitment to lifelong learning. It\u2019s why   we\u2019ve invested more than US$385 million in learning and   development opportunities in FY23. EY people have earned   more than 410,000 new digital accreditations known as   EY Badges since we launched the program in 2017, and   274 EY people have earned EY-funded master\u2019s degrees   through our fully accredited program with Hult International   Business\u00a0School.  We are also rolling out a program in FY24 to train all   EY\u00a0people on the responsible use of generative AI, as well    as experimenting with copilot models to augment the work   of EY professionals by boosting productivity and enhancing   the employee experience.   We\u2019re also investing in the communities where EY people   live and work because creating long-term value for society   broadly is also at the core of the EY NextWave strategy.   This, along with feedback from EY people, led us to set a   global science-based target, to reduce absolute total global   emissions by 40% by FY25, against an FY19 baseline.   We\u00a0are on track to meet this target, while offsetting more   emissions than we produce and accelerating our wider   transition to net zero.  The EY Ripples corporate responsibility program is the   signature EY investment in communities, with the goal to   positively impact 1 billion lives by 2030. The millions of   hours invested by EY people mean we are on track to reach   that goal, having impacted more than 127 million lives since   EY Ripples launched in 2018.  Riding the NextWave  As I begin my final year at EY, I can\u2019t help but marvel at how   much the EY organization has grown \u2014 and how the world   has changed. Two decades ago, we had 85,000 people   and US$9\u00a0billion in revenue. Today, we have almost five   times that with nearly 400,000 people and US$50 billion   in revenues. This increases the impact we can have with   EY\u00a0clients, and our communities, but also the responsibility   we have to contribute to a prosperous future for society.  During the past decade, the digital economy has grown at   more than twice the rate of the global economy. ChatGPT\u00a02.0   was released in 2019 with a 1.5-billion-word vocabulary.   Today\u2019s latest release uses 14,000 times the computing   power and has a more than 175-billion-word vocabulary.   Shifts in globalization, changing demands from consumers   and society, and the effects of climate change, all require   more investment, more resilience, and more collaboration   from the private and public sector alike. Organizations will   need the best technology, the best talent and a hyper-focus   on creating trust to continue growing successfully, and   sustainably in such dynamic, transformative\u00a0times.  That\u2019s why I am excited and optimistic about the EY   organization\u2019s future.
