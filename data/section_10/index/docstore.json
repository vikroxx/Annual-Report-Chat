Principles of governance  Theme  Metric  EY disclosure  Ethical   behavior  Anti-corruption  In addition to the annual training on the EY Code of Conduct, the EY organization has a suite of policies and   guidance to address conflicts of interest and financial crime, including the Anti-Bribery Global Policy and   the Hospitality & Gifts Global Policy, supported by robust training and communications program. Annual   Financial Crime learning is mandatory for all EY people.   The EY organization also has a global policy codifying the requirement that EY people report any concerns   about corruption or other behavior that does not comply with the EY Global Code of Conduct or applicable   laws and regulations (the NOCLAR policy, or Reporting fraud, illegal acts and other non-compliance with   laws, regulations and the EY Global Code of Conduct).  In addition to a strong internal culture, EY member firms practice in a highly regulated environment that   includes rigorous reporting obligations of unlawful conduct (including self-reporting).  The EY Global Anti-Bribery Policy is accompanied by an anti-corruption compliance program, which is   reviewed on a quarterly basis, and applicable to all EY member firms, partners and employees.  72 2023 EY VALUE REALIZED", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3580, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "index_id": "node-2", "obj": null, "class_name": "IndexNode"}, "__type__": "3"}, "318af676-d3a4-4cd7-aedf-c3251123be6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "318af676-d3a4-4cd7-aedf-c3251123be6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_number": 73}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "node-3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_number": 73}, "hash": "0a1995696c95a5929f983f873ca5f4bab84099497eec2e0cf5c287dde56b8d74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95f61247-ff24-423b-93fc-bf0963cc7695", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea706b979fbd8c27c9a0ccb60d0eb3a84620b0db768069331ab99acf33197b10", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Principles of governance  Theme  Metric  EY disclosure  Ethical   behavior  Protected   ethics advice   and reporting   mechanisms  The EY organization provides mandatory annual training on the EY Global Code of Conduct and its   associated ethics program, supported by communications throughout the EY network of member firms.

The EY organization has identified 15 key risk categories:  \u2022\tFinancial crime   \u2022\tBusiness continuity and crisis   response   \u2022\tInsider threat and culture and   business conduct   \u2022\tRegulatory and public policy   \u2022\tData protection and data ethics   \u2022\tCybersecurity   \u2022\tInformation technology   \u2022\tProgram governance and   execution   \u2022\tThird party   \u2022\tTalent management  \u2022\tService innovation   \u2022\tMacroeconomic and geopolitical   \u2022\tClient acceptance and continuance   \u2022\tIndependence   \u2022\tESG  The EY organization utilizes Archer, a tech-enabled risk management solution, to manage the planning,   monitoring and mitigation of each key risk category. Through ongoing internal consultation, the ESG risk   category has been a focus and further developed during FY23 to include a range of subcategories across   strategy execution, regulatory compliance, climate risk, market relevance, additional third-party acceptance   and continuance criteria and employee sentiment.   The ESG risk assessment has surfaced numerous ways in which EY operations or market positioning could   be threatened from ESG risks, and specifically climate-related risks. Climate-related risks threaten to   impact businesses and communities with which the EY organization works around the world, which is why   a TCFD assessment was performed to evaluate potential implications for our work with clients and broader   stakeholders.

For more information on GHG emissions   tracking, refer to page 62. Details of the external assurance can be found on page 68.  The EY organization has set an ambition to be net zero in 2025 and is delivering its carbon ambition and   continues to actively reduce its absolute GHG emissions in line with its SBTi-validated 1.5\u00b0C pathway.  Additional information on the seven actions to accomplish the EY carbon ambition to be net zero in 2025    can be found here.   TCFD   implementation  EY published its first global TCFD report this past year. The process of preparing the research and analysis   for the TCFD report provoked self-reflection. Taking stock of our climate governance, considering our climate   strategy and risk, and tracking progress against our GHG emissions goals highlight both the achievements   for which we can be justifiably proud and where we need to focus our efforts to move faster. The report   provides more information on how we\u2019re assessing and addressing climate impacts for EY people, operations   and clients.  Planet  Theme  Metrics  EY disclosure  Nature loss  Land use and   ecological   sensitivity  Annually, the EY organization conducts an analysis to review EY office locations to understand if they are   in or adjacent to key biodiversity areas. This year\u2019s analysis used the internally developed EY NAT tool to   conduct the assessment, which is a geospatial tool that collates data from more than 35 nature-related maps   to automate the identification of biodiversity and nature-related impacts.   The analysis determined that 49 EY office locations, representing approximately 6% of EY office locations   and approximately 4% of the global EY headcount, are within the buffer zone key biodiversity areas (KBAs).   This is an increase from last year\u2019s assessment due to the addition of a buffer zone, when previous years   included sites which fell directly within a KBA.  As a global network of member firms, EY locations are predominantly in major urban and business centers.   The location selection process is driven by proximity to EY clients, talent pool and business case; key   selection criteria includes a Class A office building that is well located within the city and will meet the needs   of clients, internal governance and enablement of the workforce.   We are pleased that the recent KBA mapping analysis confirmed that most offices are not in or adjacent to   key biodiversity areas. Land use management action plans are under development and the location selection   processes continue to align with EY sustainability efforts.   Fresh water   availability  Water   consumption  The EY organization WRI Aqueduct water risk assessment review covered all EY offices globally.   This year\u2019s analysis used the internally developed EY NAT tool to conduct the assessment, which is a   geospatial tool that collates data from more than 35 nature-related maps to automate the identification of   biodiversity and nature-related impacts.   In FY23, 25% of EY office locations, representing 40% of EY headcount, were deemed to be in high or   extremely high baseline water stress areas.  A global data management system has been implemented to track and report water usage. Water   management action plans will be developed to reduce our own consumption, further reduce water-related   risks and support the local communities in which we operate, especially those in areas of high or extremely   high baseline water\u00a0stress.   74 2023 EY VALUE REALIZED", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4644, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "index_id": "node-5", "obj": null, "class_name": "IndexNode"}, "__type__": "3"}, "8d1b5326-7662-430e-afd3-bc0ee649ce25": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d1b5326-7662-430e-afd3-bc0ee649ce25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_number": 75}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "node-6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_number": 75}, "hash": "271ef263ff38b6947304f0e6b6f6b0dfd1c77975f5bfcd2927dfc7b263adebf7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b94bcac-2020-4ffb-a8ce-e41f8ef78b1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "983184485b1ac4247e3a5112dc7443a837b56d2f74012f9d9a79013a95f26d7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Reporting against the WEF-IBC Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics  People  Theme  Metric  EY disclosure  Dignity and   equality  D&I  We are committed to nurturing an environment where differences are valued, practices are equitable, and   everyone experiences a sense of belonging at the EY organization.
