      "text": "DNV assurance verification letter  Independent Assurance Statement  Introduction  DNV Business Assurance USA, Inc. (DNV) has been commissioned by the management of EYGS LLP   (“EYGS”) to provide limited level assurance of Selected Performance Information as presented in the EY 2023   Value Realized Report (“The Report”) for the reporting year ended June 30, 2023. The assurance was carried   out June through September 2023.  EYGS has sole responsibility for preparation of the data contained in the Report. DNV, in performing our   assurance work, is responsible to the management of EYGS. Our assurance statement, however, represents   our independent opinion and is intended to inform all stakeholders including EYGS.   Level of Assurance  We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance   Engagements (ISAE) 3000 revised — ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical   Financial Information’, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard   requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain   limited assurance.  DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, in accordance with   ISO/IEC 17029:2019 - Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification   of management systems, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including   documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards   and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing, and are less in extent   than for a reasonable assurance engagement; the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower than would   have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. We planned and performed our   work to obtain the evidence we considered sufficient to provide a basis for our opinion, so that the risk of this   conclusion being in error is reduced, but not reduced to very low.  All assurance engagements are subject to inherent limitations as selective testing (sampling) may not detect   errors, fraud or other irregularities. Non-financial data may be subject to greater inherent uncertainty than   financial data, given the nature and methods used for calculating, estimating and determining such data. The   selection of different, but acceptable measurement techniques may result in different quantifications between   different entities.   DNV’s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by EYGS   to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith. This includes but is not limited to sales and   acquisitions, square footage, occupancy rates, data coverage, and financial/operational control. DNV expressly   disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this   Independent Assurance Statement.   Assurance Methodology  DNV is a leading provider of sustainability services, including verification of GHG emissions data and other   environmental metrics. Our environmental and social assurance specialists work in over 100 countries.  In that respect, the Selected Performance Information have been evaluated against the following   reporting criteria:  •\t World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/World Resources institute (WRI)   Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Accounting Standard REVISED EDITION  •\t WBCSD/WRI Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard  DNV used a risk-based approach throughout the assurance engagement, concentrating on the areas that   we believe are most material for both EYGS and its stakeholders. DNV applied a materiality threshold of five   percent for all GHG emissions and Energy Consumption. DNV applied International Standards Organization   (ISO) guidance for determining the sample size.  The following methods were applied during the assurance of EYGS’ Selected Performance data and   management processes  •\t Review of documentation, data records and sources relating to data claims  •\t Review of the processes and tools used to collect, aggregate, and report on data and metrics  •\t Interview of managers and data users representing relevant functions for supporting the data   management processes  •\t Assessment of data systems and controls, including:  •\t Selection and management of all relevant data  •\t Processes for collecting, processing, consolidating, and reporting the data  •\t Systems and processes that ensure the accuracy of the data  •\t Design and maintenance of the data systems  •\t Systems and processes that support the data information systems data  •\t Performed sample-based audits of the processes for generating, gathering, and managing the data  •\t Examination of the data to develop evidence for the assessment of the data and assertions made  •\t Evaluation of whether the organization conforms to the reporting criteria  •\t Evaluation of whether the evidence and data are sufficient and support EYGS’ claims  Assurance Opinion  Based on the processes and procedures conducted with a limited assurance, there is no evidence that the data   assertions set forth in Selected Information are not materially correct and are not a fair representation of the   data and information, and have not been prepared in accordance with the calculation method referenced.   Independence  DNV was not involved in the preparation of any part of EYGS’s data or report. This is our second year providing   assurance for EYGS. We adopt a balanced approach towards all stakeholders when performing our evaluation.  For and on behalf of DNV Business Assurance USA, Inc.
