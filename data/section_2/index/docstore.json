We also have an extensive mindfulness network   with global and regional leaders who are passionate about   supporting the development and wellbeing of EY people.   We continue to examine how we can demonstrate a strong   commitment to self-care and supporting EY people to find   the right level of balance for their life circumstances. When   we identify a challenge, we seek to address it immediately, as   evidenced by the commitment to act on feedback presented   in an independent, comprehensive EY Oceania culture review   conducted in FY23.  Continuing lifelong learning  Learning and development is a core part of building a   personalized career and the exceptional EY experience. At\u00a0EY,   we are investing in all EY people for today and for the future   by offering learning and development programs that help to   develop new skills in emerging areas like technology, AI and   sustainability. In FY23, we spent US$385\u00a0million on training   and delivered 61 hours of learning per person on\u00a0average.  Following the success of the EY Tech MBA and the EY Masters   in Business Analytics, last year we launched another new fully   accredited qualification in association with Hult International   Business School \u2014 the EY Masters in Sustainability. This year,   we celebrated our sixth and largest ever EY Tech MBA cohort   with 74 graduates and the first-ever cohort of EY Masters in   Sustainability, totaling 274\u00a0graduates across our EY Degrees.   These degrees are free for EY people, regardless of rank or   location, with the aim of helping them gain the knowledge,   practical skills and experience they need to create long-term   value for EY clients, people and society.   All of the EY Degrees are built on the EY Badges program.   Today there are 227 badges on offer, from Bronze level to   Platinum, across three pillars (technology, business and   leadership) and 27 topics ranging from AI to sustainability   Continuous listening  Knowing how people feel and what they need, is crucial to   enabling their personal and professional success. Listening   tools like EY People Pulse \u2014 a short experience survey we   offer to all EY people three times a year \u2014 is one of the ways   we do this. Through the Pulse and our other listening tools,   people have told us they want a workplace where they can   feel free to bring their whole selves to work, they want to be   recognized and appreciated for their contributions, and that   they want to be able to focus on their wellbeing and growing   their career. Today, 86% of EY people are proud to work at   EY. While this is slightly down on last year\u2019s 88%, our holistic,   continuous People Listening and Experience program helps   us know where to invest further to drive long\u2011term value for   everyone at EY.  Prioritizing wellbeing   Helping EY people prioritize their wellbeing helps ensure   they have a more well-rounded and positive EY experience.   We recognize that mental health and wellbeing are key   concerns for our profession. Given this, we strive to provide   a safe work environment for all EY people and frequently   review EY wellbeing benefits to align with their needs. Today,   the global EY organization offers more than 100\u00a0wellbeing   programs across four pillars: physical, mental/emotional,   social and financial. These offerings include employee   assistance programs and wellbeing apps that focus on sleep   and exercise, physical challenges, reimbursement funds   for wellness-related purchases (e.g.,\u00a0exercise equipment,   nutritionist) and expanded coverage and support for mental   health.

We are focusing further on how   learning impacts skills development to understand how   we can support EY people to develop the skills they want   and\u00a0need.  An experience that can take you anywhere  Global mobility provides unique opportunities to inspire   EY people with what\u2019s possible. It enables EY people to   build cross-border networks to further build the global   mindset they need as the next generation of transformative   leaders. In addition, global mobility brings the whole of EY   to clients by meeting their needs whenever or wherever   they are, through strategic and resourcing mobility and   business travel. Mobility4U is the EY international mobility   program that allows all EY professionals to work in a   multicultural environment so that they can continue to   develop. Ninety\u2011three percent of the program\u2019s participants   410,000+  EY Badges earned since 2017  EY people  Attracting and recruiting top talent  This year, 4.7 million people applied to work at EY, out of which 138,000 were hired. To attract and recruit top talent, maintaining   an exceptional experience is critical. We\u2019re enhancing the candidate experience to leverage new technology (for example, a global   applicant tracking system, candidate relationship management tools, chatbots, robotic process automation, online psychometric and   gamified assessments, and video interviewing technology). We continue to streamline processes for faster, more transparent hiring,   and provide an onboarding program that sets new joiners up for success from day one. As a result, 93% of recent hires have had an   exceptional recruiting experience.

To help EY clients tackle their toughest challenges, we   need the best ideas from the broadest group of people, and   teaming and leading with inclusiveness underpins our actions   to create meaningful work experiences for everyone at EY.   Our overarching global DE&I priority statement is \u201cEnrich the   diversity, equity and inclusiveness of our culture, leadership   and teams.\u201d  DE&I governance and measuring progress   To demonstrate our commitment to DE&I, the EY Global   Executive, the central EY organization leadership body,   signed the Global Executive Diversity, Equity & Inclusiveness   Statement. Not only does this reinforce that DE&I is a key   business lever, but it also ensures that we hold ourselves   accountable for progress. As such, the EY Global Executive   will promote representation of the broad range of   differences across the EY organization globally at the most   senior levels. To set a consistent path around the world we   use the DE&I\u00a0Roadmap and Culture Change Continuum, our   approach and methodology for DE&I.  The roadmap is brought to life by the EY Global Diversity,   Equity and Inclusiveness Steering Committee (GDEISC),   which is co-chaired by EY Global Chairman and CEO   Carmine Di Sibio and EY Global Vice Chair \u2014 Diversity,   Equity & Inclusiveness Karyn Twaronite. Its members,   drawn from across the organization, explore challenges,   surface successful practices and collaborate on   meaningful\u00a0solutions.  For accountability to DE&I progress across the EY   organization, we use the Global DE&I Tracker as a   measurement of diversity and inclusiveness that covers a   range of differences, both visible and not visible, including   people\u2019s lived experiences. It sets a business and industry   A more diverse, equitable    and inclusive workplace  To help EY clients tackle   their toughest challenges,   we\u00a0need the best ideas from   the broadest group of people,   and teaming and leading with   inclusiveness underpins our   actions to create meaningful   work experiences for   everyone\u00a0at EY.

To deliver on EY commitments to advance social equity,   our focus areas include:   \u2022\t Raising consciousness of social equity and inclusiveness  \u2022\t Challenging internal systems, processes and programs   through an equity lens   \u2022\t Building higher level inclusive leadership practices and   skills among all EY people   \u2022\t Inspiring greater social equity and inclusiveness among   clients, suppliers and communities  leading-class standard in both representation and   inclusiveness goals and tracks progress across the EY   organization globally and for each business unit and service   line in support of our NextWave ambition and strategy.   Now in its fourth year, the Global DE&I Tracker is a   key management tool that helps drive consistent DE&I   actions and propels the organization collectively forward.   Measurements include reviewing diversity of career   and work experience and gender in leadership roles. In   addition, we review aggregated data on gender and cultural   background differentials in responses from internal people   surveys for insights on how people experience inclusiveness   at EY. We\u00a0continue to see collective progress across the   organization, as well as see areas where we can focus   efforts and close gaps to ensure our people have access to   inclusive, equitable\u00a0experiences.   We continue to make progress on gender representation   among EY leadership roles globally, as well as on locally   relevant diversity dimensions measured at the country   level, where permitted. For example, women make up 33%   of the EY Global Executive and 29% of the Global Practice   Group, which is a leadership body that brings together the   \u201c  When an organization builds a culture that values all dimensions of diversity \u2014 one that provides equitable   opportunities for people to grow, learn and advance \u2014 it creates an environment where everyone can thrive.

Global recognition for our DE&I efforts  EY receives recognition around the world for our DE&I efforts, a testament to our focus and commitment to make a positive   impact. This past year, globally, the EY organization was shortlisted for the Inclusion & Diversity Impact award and Inclusion   Award by World50, and the EY Global DE&I Leader was recognized by Diversity Global Magazine as one of the Top 15 Chief   Diversity Officers.

The Valuable 500\u2019s five global standardized disability inclusion KPIs  Workforce   representation  What percentage of the company\u2019s workforce   identifies as disabled/living with a disability?  Of those who responded to a recent internal survey of EY people, 3.4% identified as having a disability. This question was   asked in over 70 countries, representing 70% of EY total headcount.  Goals  Which goals has the company defined specific   to disability inclusion and how are business   leaders measured against these goals?  The EY Global DE&I Tracker contains questions about disability practices, such as accessibility, reasonable adjustments/  accommodations, and integration of neurodivergent professionals throughout the business. All EY leaders are encouraged   to set DE&I goals, which can include disability specific goals. Progress toward meeting these goals is tracked annually.  Training  Does your company provide disability inclusion   training for its managers and employers?  EY people are encouraged to complete a customized training on inclusive leadership, which integrates   disability\u2011specific\u00a0content.  Employee resource   groups (ERGs)  Does your company have a disability specific   ERG in place with an executive sponsor?  EY has various disability-specific ERGs at the country, Region and Area level. For example, we have networks focused on   disabilities in the Americas, Brazil, UK & Ireland, and Asia-Pacific. Some locations also have topic-specific communities,   for example on deafness/hard of hearing, blindness/low vision and stammering/stuttering. One of the largest is our   1,500-member global neurodiversity community. The EY Global Vice Chair of Transformation is the Global Disability   Sponsor, and there are senior-level executive sponsors in each of our three global Areas. Region, country and local   chapters typically have their own executive sponsors.  Digital    accessibility  Has your company undertaken a review of    the accessibility of its digital platforms   and content? If not, does the company   have a plan to\u00a0undertake a review   over the next calendar year?  Since 2019, the organization has had a Global Digital Accessibility Policy (which is monitored regularly) that mandates   all new development of digital tools and content to follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Enterprise websites\u00a0\u2014   the\u00a0ey.com public website and our intranet \u2014 are fully accessible. Accessibility is integrated into our development   methodology and procurement processes. We have trained our designers, developers and content creators to create   accessible products and content and conduct regular accessibility reviews of our sites, tools and content.  *\u0007  \u2009\u2009\u0007  The disclosure questions in the table are in a standard format issued by The Valuable 500, and are answered with respect to the EY organization.  20 2023 EY VALUE REALIZED", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3183, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "index_id": "node-12", "obj": null, "class_name": "IndexNode"}, "__type__": "3"}, "7394781f-ded4-46aa-afac-0882557f7118": {"__data__": {"id_": "7394781f-ded4-46aa-afac-0882557f7118", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_number": 21}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "node-13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_number": 21}, "hash": "1a4b49295cda27c332cbd36a6dae89283892ba017cab0dc048662bad08c2fbb2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91df8b95-8692-4a21-9419-e537dd7e7ce2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "22a223506766d0f13544a0fbcca4ae546dd0fd1bd7eb75b4030b001141a67fb5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A neurodiverse world is a better working world   Tapping into the talents of neurodivergent professionals   in the EY Neuro-Diverse Centers of Excellence helps us   accelerate EY clients\u2019 sustainable value journey and workforce   transformation plans through collaborative ecosystems   around the world.
