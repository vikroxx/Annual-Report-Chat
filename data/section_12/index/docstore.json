Our key focus areas are:  \u2022\t Supporting the next generation workforce  \u2022\t Working with impact entrepreneurs   \u2022\t Accelerating environmental sustainability  The focus areas were chosen to align EY strengths with the   United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).   Activities outside of these focus areas are not recorded as   part of EY Ripples.   There are two key metrics to assess the impact of EY Ripples:  \u2022\t Lives impacted  \u2022\t Ripples participation   Lives impacted methodology   The lives impacted methodology for measuring social value   is based on the long-term value impact pathway, which is a   theory of change that provides a framework for monitoring   and evaluating outcomes and impacts. The methodology   measures the outcome and value addition of EY initiatives   in the community. It quantifies the impact by specifically   evaluating how many lives were positively impacted from   the initiative through assessing both the breadth and   depth of impact the EY Ripples initiatives are having.   The\u00a0methodology uses the EY Ripples Portal data, as well   as external data\u00a0sources.  As a conservative approach, only those who interact   directly with the primary beneficiary are considered   indirect beneficiaries for each initiative. Each focus   area of the EY Ripples program requires its own set of   assumptions, approaches, and beneficiaries for calculating   the lives impacted.   Quantifying depth of impact was arrived at through   stakeholder interviews and external third-party research.   The EY organization has also integrated country-level SDG   performance scores into its measurement approach to   assess attribution in a systematic way where activity specific   data is not available.   As part of quality control and data validation, the data from   the EY Ripples Portal is routinely validated by the EY Ripples   Global Measurement and Reporting (M&R) team.   EY Ripples participation methodology   In the context of EY Ripples, participation is defined as the   number of EY individuals who are using or have used their   knowledge, skills and experience and energy to deliver   initiatives. Unique participation ensures all EY individuals   are only included once. All EY employees, partners and   principals can take part in EY Ripples.   The EY Ripples Portal serves as a recruitment platform,   with the primary goal of matching EY people with Ripples   opportunities. It is a one-stop-shop for people to create,   manage and participate in EY Ripples initiatives.   Participation is tracked as part of the lifecycle of an initiative.   Once an initiative is approved and published on the EY   Ripples portal, potential participants can locate it and apply.   An initiative owner will approve or decline based on a set of   standards for the volunteer role. Once an initiative is running,   approved applicants become participants. At an initiative\u2019s   conclusion, an automatically generated feedback survey is   sent to all those who registered for an initiative and were   approved. If the individual\u2019s response is that they did not   participate, they are removed from the participation count.   If\u00a0they respond otherwise or do not respond, they continue to   be included in the count. This acts as a control to ensure we   maintain the accuracy of recorded participation numbers.   Participation is the sum of all registrations that are approved   or completed. The identifier that is used to track individual   participants is the EY email address.
