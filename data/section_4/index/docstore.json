Committing to nature-positivity and how targets will be monitored  As our understanding of the impacts of biodiversity loss on society, the planet and business evolves, we are committed to defining   what nature-positive means for the EY organization and how related targets will be monitored. Nature ties into almost every social,   cultural and economic issue that we experience because it is the fundamental component on which these things are built. We are   investing in developing a nature-positive strategy that will include a commitment to assess our value chain through a science-based   and location-specific methodology, setting clear and measurable targets across our value chain, transforming our services in line   with nature-positive principles and evaluating and disclosing our performance authentically and transparently. We recognize that we   don\u2019t yet have all the answers, but we are committed to developing a roadmap to begin, building on our existing analysis.   Through this process, we will expand our key biodiverse areas (KBAs) and water risk assessments to identify ways to mitigate these   issues near the affected offices. For the third year, we have conducted these assessments for the global EY real estate portfolio,   and this year we were able to utilize the EY NAT tool, which found that 6% of EY offices are in or adjacent to KBAs and 25% of offices   were deemed high or extremely high baseline water stress areas.

How EY audits are contributing to a net-zero   global economy  The sustainable finance agenda, including reporting and   assurance standards, is an important driver of a net-zero   global economy, protecting environmental, social and   financial value. In this regard, EY member firms take their   audit roles extremely seriously.   Although there is no single explicit standard on climate\u2011related   matters under International Financial Reporting Standards   (IFRS) Accounting Standards and other generally accepted   accounting principles, climate-related matters may impact   several areas of accounting. While the immediate effect on   the financial statements may not necessarily be quantitatively   significant, there are increasing expectations from   stakeholders that entities explain how climate-related matters   are considered in preparing their financial statements to the   extent they may be material from a qualitative perspective.   This includes robust disclosures on the most significant   assumptions, estimates and judgements made related to   climate change.

Integrating sustainability into what EY teams do to support clients  Building collaborative teams across disciplines is a distinctive part of how sustainability is integrated into what EY teams do to   support clients with operationalizing ESG reporting and navigating the emerging sustainability reporting requirements. For example,   professionals from EY Climate Change and Sustainability Services (CCaSS) and EY Financial Accounting Advisory Services (FAAS)   are working to elevate the rigor needed to enhance sustainability governance, reporting policies, processes and technology to satisfy   requirements in any jurisdiction. This year, approximately 3,200 EY CCaSS professionals collaborated to complete 5,000 client   engagements worldwide, a 66% increase on FY22.   44 2023 EY VALUE REALIZED", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3556, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "index_id": "node-21", "obj": null, "class_name": "IndexNode"}, "__type__": "3"}, "6cf18612-3446-4b1c-863a-c5b7f631cbe8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cf18612-3446-4b1c-863a-c5b7f631cbe8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_number": 45}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "node-22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_number": 45}, "hash": "8293b43d83de428a5be964534677e3032c0dd337c1019af5c878d328b7ff2135", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e47f3b67-1652-4ca2-bb73-aa624c2fb364", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b712a4ca457ac0d3e9188290d101fe93893063201d6a19cabbaec109694906e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022\t The race to net zero: why it\u2019s critical for businesses to   act boldly on climate  \u2022\t Why ESG performance is growing in importance for   investors?
